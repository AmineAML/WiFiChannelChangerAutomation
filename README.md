# WiFiChannelChangerAutomation
Automation of switching between 2 channels

## Requirements:
  - Selenium
  - WebDriver
 
The download and installation instruction can be found from this link [Selenium with Python](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html).

## For Windows: Batch file configuration
1. Navigate to home directory.
2. Create a .bat file (for example: change_channel.bat).
3. Edit that batch file using any text editor.
4. Open cmd and write the command (for example: change_channel) then press enter to execute the python script.


NOTE: If the PATH to the python script contains spaces make sure to write it between 2 quote "PATH".  
NOTE: Also if the PATH contains special characters, this won't be readable for the cmd thus from the Batch file add: chcp 65001  
Why chcp 65001? chcp 65001 is for UTF-8.
